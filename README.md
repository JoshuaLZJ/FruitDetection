# Upload And Display Image with object detection In ASP.NET Core 3.1

This project allows a user to upload an image in an IFormFile and then the OnnxModel will process the image for object detection. The processed image will then be saved in the SQL database.

The code to train the custom object detection models can be found in the CustomTensorFlowTraining folder.
